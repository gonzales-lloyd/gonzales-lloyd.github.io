There are some moves we can say are up to chance.

For example, adapting the game "Five" from [[Extensive Form]], let's say that the rules of the game are changed so that player 1's **second** move has allowable moves as dictated by the roll of a die. Call this game "Five with a die." The rules are as follow:
- If player 1 rolls a 1 or a 2, their allowable moves are "1".
- If player 1 rolls a 3, 4, or 5, their allowable moves are "1" or "2".
- If player 1 rolls a 6, their allowable moves are "1", "2", or "3".

For example, let's say a game plays out as:
- Player 1: "1"
- Player 2: "1"
- Player 1 rolls a 5 and says "1".
- Player 2 says "2", yielding a payoff of $(-2, 2)$.

The extensive form of such a game becomes much more complicated.

Of note is that the continuations of vertices $F$ and $G$ are the exact same (player 1 cannot say "3", so they can only say 1 or 2 regardless of what they roll above 2).

Note how nodes *either* represent the decision of a player **or** a chance node.
